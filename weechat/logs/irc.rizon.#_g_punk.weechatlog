2021-12-25 10:10:58	@assa	bfx: what's it about?
2021-12-25 10:11:04	bfx	go for the sobriety; better sleep and wine when you wake up
2021-12-25 10:11:53	@assa	also going through python programming lessons because nothing better to do
2021-12-25 10:11:57	bfx	assa: geotechnical stuff in vegas, basically seems like soil sampling, building & industrial type geoscience (will building foundation become weak when water is introduced?)
2021-12-25 10:12:21	bfx	drill here, don't drill there, trench work

2021-12-25 10:13:48	bfx	thanks n-word
2021-12-25 10:14:13	@assa	bfx: I did that for a few months, didn't like it. you'll be working on construction sites
2021-12-25 10:14:40	@assa	but the machinery is fun
2021-12-25 10:14:43	@assa	got bored quite quickly tho
2021-12-25 10:15:10	bfx	assa: yeah i figure as much, but i have a big semester ahead of me and i can also work in the lab which is 24/7 make your own hours
2021-12-25 10:15:17	bfx	i also don't mind construction sites
2021-12-25 10:15:20	bfx	i feel comfortable on them
2021-12-25 10:16:57	@assa	eh, maybe it was because the company I worked for does environmental stuff too, but I spent most of my time on old gas stations, dams/dykes, and waste water treatment plants. Main reason I quit was that they were really disogranized and we had to drive a lot, and they all smoked in the car which I hate.
2021-12-25 10:17:15	@assa	I prefer lab work 
2021-12-25 10:18:47	bfx	ah yeah. this company seems a bit similar - lots of time in the truck (but they pay for gas and your car payment!) and one guy says he smokes pot when he just sits in the truck (lol wut)
2021-12-25 10:19:10	bfx	for us it's more future mines, pot farms, highways and ways to bring water to the desert
2021-12-25 10:19:21	bfx	then in the city itself it's just new buildings
2021-12-25 10:19:40	@assa	nice
2021-12-25 10:20:02	bfx	what should my 'objective' be for my resume
2021-12-25 10:20:15	bfx	`Join the team at $company' ?
2021-12-25 10:20:20	bfx	sounds a bit boring
2021-12-25 10:20:41	@assa	I worked at a construction engineering consulting company. they would just do plans and pre-assessments or environmental assessments (like at gas stations to see if any gasoline would have seeped into the ground. it always did)
2021-12-25 10:20:49	bfx	yeah
2021-12-25 10:21:56	@assa	I really didn't like working there. Everyone thought they were the best in their field, they never admitted to being overloaded with work while playing it cool, I had to fight to get enough hours, and some collegues were really strange. I quit after 2 months
2021-12-25 10:22:24	@assa	went back to fulltime bike messenger
2021-12-25 10:22:49	@assa	.decide finish this python lesson or leave some for tomorrow

2021-12-25 10:22:53	@assa	now what?
2021-12-25 10:23:02	@assa	my fingertips are already sore from all the bass playing
2021-12-25 10:23:34	@assa	bfx: what sort of work are you doing at the lab?
2021-12-25 10:23:49	bfx	no idea i haven't even applied yet lol
2021-12-25 10:23:58	bfx	was just at the bar last night with this masters student who worked there, he told me to apply
2021-12-25 10:24:05	@assa	do it
2021-12-25 10:24:34	bfx	assa: lets roll a mf'in joint
2021-12-25 10:24:46	@assa	maybe include that in your motivation letter. that you heard from other students about the lab and that you'd like to join their team to learn and grow with the company
2021-12-25 10:25:56	@assa	you gotta sell it to them, tho. what advantage do they have when hiring you. like you work meticulously, have a solid grasp on lab work, the chemistry and mathematics behind it, and are good at excel (or w/e maths software they use)
2021-12-25 10:27:12	bfx	i am cheap, i know how to log core samples, i know how to run a drill program, and i have msha + osha certs
2021-12-25 10:27:18	bfx	unlike other undergrads i can actually work
2021-12-25 10:27:35	@assa	that's a plus
2021-12-25 10:27:46	@assa	and a driver's license?
2021-12-25 10:27:50	bfx	yes
2021-12-25 10:27:53	@assa	dunno how "normal" that is in the US
2021-12-25 10:27:57	@assa	but here it's important to mention
2021-12-25 10:27:59	bfx	you are expected to have one
2021-12-25 10:28:11	bfx	nondriver = how you gettin to work?
