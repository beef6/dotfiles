2021-12-25 13:30:10	NJ	doesnt have a trendy mask.
2021-12-25 13:30:13	chaumurky	me mum actually almost joined an RAF related cell
2021-12-25 13:30:25	chaumurky	back in the 70s
2021-12-25 13:30:50	NJ	best she didnt, but good on her for getting out there and meeting people.
2021-12-25 13:31:05	chaumurky	well
2021-12-25 13:31:21	chaumurky	she met a cult and joined it, so...
2021-12-25 13:31:43	chaumurky	but at least she wasnt killed by gsg9
2021-12-25 13:31:46	NJ	she ever run into Patty Hurst?
2021-12-25 13:32:27	chaumurky	no she dropped out before actual application of terrorism
2021-12-25 13:32:48	NJ	again, solid judgement call.
2021-12-25 13:33:16	chaumurky	well no she joined a cult and I had to grow up in it
2021-12-25 13:33:28	NJ	but damn did our parents live far more interesting lives than us
2021-12-25 13:34:17	chaumurky	I find our lives with covid interestin enough
2021-12-25 13:34:22	NJ	this wasnt held at your familial place on the riviera?

2021-12-25 13:38:02	chaumurky	im from the old world,everything is old pretty
2021-12-25 13:38:14	NJ	you seen how archetecture is goin in straya? we are puritanical when it comes to beauty

2021-12-25 13:38:56	chaumurky	well the most famous australian landmark certainly isnt puritanical

2021-12-25 13:39:21	chaumurky	i mean the thing in sydney
2021-12-25 13:39:55	NJ	is it a 'big' thing? we've got a bunch. theyre not always particularly big.
2021-12-25 13:40:24	NJ	ohoh Opera House?
2021-12-25 13:40:46	chaumurky	well yeah
2021-12-25 13:40:56	NJ	I went there once. 
2021-12-25 13:41:21	NJ	its not a very good space, is its problem
2021-12-25 13:41:24	chaumurky	did you get a tshirt?
2021-12-25 13:41:48	NJ	dont think so. i was a tiny kid
2021-12-25 13:42:02	NJ	sydney is awful.
2021-12-25 13:42:21	chaumurky	the sydney opera house is hugely famous and symbolic in other countries, same as the brandburg, eventhough that is really shitty
2021-12-25 13:42:36	chaumurky	*gate
2021-12-25 13:42:41	NJ	but my point is though i dont care for the archetecture its more importantly awful acoustically
2021-12-25 13:43:08	NJ	but its got a society of rich fartsniffing opera goers behind it
2021-12-25 13:43:33	NJ	while sydneys live music scene has been stripped for parts over the last 20 years
2021-12-25 13:44:19	chaumurky	thats so typical

2021-12-25 13:48:30	NJ	not about to blow undue smoke and say better, but history is important
2021-12-25 13:49:13	NJ	we've got a heidelberg in melbourne! worked there for 10 years, its a ghastly suburb
